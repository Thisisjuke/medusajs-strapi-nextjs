## How to start ? Nowhere.

Sorry guys, I have been totaly beaten by the Stapi plugin ecosystem.

I have been developping this plugin all day for few months and now I switched to : https://github.com/payloadcms/payload.

You can still see what I achieved with Strapi's custom field API. It's not much but it's honest work.
